    Lyrics:<br>
    
    I love you
I love you<br>
I love you<br>
Baby I love you, you are my life<br>
My happiest moments weren't complete if you weren't by my side<br>
You're my relation and connection to the sun<br>
You next to me, there's no darkness I can't overcome<br>
You are my raindrops, I am the sea<br>
You and God who's my sunlight, I'm blooming, grown so beautifully<br>
Baby I'm so proud, proud to be your girl<br>
You make the confusion go all away from this cold and misty world<br>
<em>I am in love with you,<br>
You set me free<br>
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me<br>
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you<br>
I'll never leave<br>
Just, just keep loving me the way I love you loving me<br>
I am in love with you<br>
You set me free<br>
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me<br>
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with </em>you<br>
I'll never leave<br>
Just keep loving me the way I love you loving me<br>
I know you love me, love me for who I am<br>
'Cause years before I became who I am, baby you were my man<br>
I know it ain't easy, easy loving me<br>
I appreciate the love and dedication from you to me<br>
Later on in my destiny I see myself having your child<br>
I see myself being your wife and I see my whole future in your eyes<br>
Thought of all my love for you, sometimes makes me wanna cry<br>
Realize all of my blessings, I'm grateful to have you by my side<br>
I am in love with you<br>
You set me free<br>
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me<br>
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you<br>
<strong>I'll never leave<br>
Just, just keep loving me the way I love you loving me<br>
I am in love with you<br>
You set me free<br>
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me<br>
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you<br>
I'll never leave<br></strong>
Just keep loving me the way I love you loving me<br>
Every time I see your face, my heart smiles<br>
Every time it feels so good, it hurts sometimes<br>
Created in this world to love<br>
To hold, to feel, to breathe, to live you<br>
Dangerously in love, yeah<br>
I am in love with you<br>
You set me free<br>
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me<br>
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you<br>
I'll never leave<br>
Just, just keep loving me the way I love you loving me<br>
I am in love with you<br>
You set me free<br>
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me<br>
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you<br>
I'll never leave<br>
Just keep loving me the way I love you loving me<br>
Dangerously<br>
Dangerous, dangerously in love with you<br>
Oh, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you<br>
I love you, oh yes<br>
I love you<br>
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you<br>
I love you<br>
I love you<br>
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you<br>
Dangerously in love<br>
I will survive the past,<br>
I will survive the fear<br>
and I will survive<br>
